    title: "About Noël"
    text: "I’m a researcher, writer, and educator originally from Sacramento, CA. I’m currently pursuing a PhD at Boston College in English, where I explore twentieth- and twenty-first American literature and culture, feminist and gender theory, disability studies, and medical and health humanities. Prior to my doctoral work, I taught extensively at the secondary level in the Los Angeles area, designing interdisciplinary, project-based curricula for a variety of humanities courses. I hold a MA in American Studies from  Pepperdine University and a BA in psychology with a minor in English from the University of California at Davis. I received my teaching certification from Loyola Marymount University through the LMU | Teach For America Partnership and hold clear CA teaching credentials in English, art, and Career and Technical Education with an emphasis on Marketing, Sales, and Service."

    title: "Teaching"
    text: "In my seven years as a secondary educator, I’ve worked exclusively with high-need populations; every teaching position I’ve held has been at a Title 1 school, meaning that the school served a high concentration of families with low socioeconomic status. I’m well-versed in teaching strategies and methodology for students with diverse needs, including English Language Learners and students with disabilities. I love collaboration and interdisciplinary course design."
