I’m passionate about interdisciplinary curricular design that incorporates student technology and student interests. Whether I’m crafting curricula for middle, high school, or undergraduate students, I ground my work in recent, subject-specific scholarship and [ the UDL framework](http://www.cast.org/our-work/about-udl.html?utm_source=udlguidelines&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=none&utm_content=homepage#.XyNaPvhKjCA) . I’ve served as a Course Writer, developing course descriptions for [ University of California “a-g” subject approval](https://hs-articulation.ucop.edu/agcmp#/login) . Additionally, I’ve developed Career and Technical Education curricula for the [ California Department of Education](https://www.cteonline.org/) , and the [ Western History Association has recognized my teaching by granting me the Redd Center Teaching Western History Award](https://www.westernhistory.org/awards/redd-center) .
